# SISO App Factory - Master Setup Prompt for AI Agents

> **Purpose**: Guide AI agents through comprehensive planning for new application projects before writing any code.

## 🎯 Mission

You are helping plan a **new [INDUSTRY] application** from scratch. Your goal is to complete ALL planning phases before any implementation begins. This ensures:

- ✅ Evidence-based decisions
- ✅ Comprehensive feature coverage
- ✅ Solid architecture foundation
- ✅ Clear build roadmap
- ✅ No missed requirements

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. **Project created**: Run `./setup-new-project.sh "<project-name>" "<industry>"`
2. **BMAD downloaded**: Auto-downloaded by setup script
3. **Target location**: Know where project files will be created
4. **Industry context**: Understand the business domain

## 🚀 Planning Phase Workflow

Follow these phases **in order**. Complete each phase fully before moving to the next.

**NEW in v3.0**: After EACH phase, you MUST self-verify your work against the validation checklist before proceeding. This reduces errors by 40-75%.

**Verification Protocol**:
```
Generate Output → Self-Verify (load validation/phase-XX-checklist.md) →
Score ≥ threshold? → YES: Proceed | NO: Fix & Retry (max 3 attempts)
```

| Phase 6 | `validation/phase-06-domain-ops-checklist.md` | ≥80% (12/15) | CRUD ops, workflows, BMAD |
| Phase 7 | `validation/phase-07-database-checklist.md` | ≥85% (13/15) | 20-50 tables, RLS, ERD |
| Phase 8 | `validation/phase-08-buildplan-checklist.md` | ≥80% (12/15) | 100+ tasks, timeline |
| **Phase 9** | `validation/phase-09-pdr-checklist.md` | **≥90% (18/20)** | All 13 sections, no [TBD] |

**Higher thresholds** for Phase 4.5 (UI/UX critical) and Phase 9 (final deliverable).

### Verification Protocol

For each phase:
```
1. Complete phase work
2. Load validation/phase-XX-checklist.md
3. Check each criterion (✅ Pass or ❌ Fail)
4. Calculate: Score = (Passed / Total) × 100%
5. If score ≥ threshold → ✅ Proceed to next phase
6. If score < threshold → ❌ Fix issues, re-verify (max 3 attempts)
7. If 3 failures → Escalate to human review
8. Log results to LangFuse (if configured)
```

**Read**: `validation/chain-of-verification-protocol.md` for detailed methodology.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Option (Advanced)

For higher quality planning, use **6 specialist agents** instead of a single agent:

### Agent Assignment

| Agent | File | Phases | Specialization |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| Researcher | `prompts/multi-agent/01-researcher-agent.md` | 1-2 | Market research, competitive analysis |
| Product Manager | `prompts/multi-agent/02-product-manager-agent.md` | 3 | Feature prioritization, user stories |
| Architect | `prompts/multi-agent/03-architect-agent.md` | 4 | System design, tech stack |
| **UI/UX Designer** | `prompts/multi-agent/04-ui-ux-designer-agent.md` | 4.5 | User flows, wireframes, design system |
| Domain Engineer | `prompts/multi-agent/05-domain-engineer-agent.md` | 5-7 | Components, operations, database |
| QA Engineer | `prompts/multi-agent/06-qa-engineer-agent.md` | 8-9 | Build plan, PDR, final QA |

### How to Use

**Tell Claude Code CLI**:
```
"Use multi-agent orchestration for this planning session.
Start with Agent 1 (Researcher).
Read: .siso/project-setup-system/prompts/multi-agent/README.md"
```

Claude will:
1. Execute Researcher agent (Phases 1-2)
2. Verify Researcher's work
3. Handoff to Product Manager agent
4. Execute PM agent (Phase 3)
5. Verify PM's work
6. Handoff to Architect → UI/UX Designer → Domain Engineer → QA Engineer
7. Each agent self-verifies before handing off
8. Final output: Complete PDR ready for implementation

**Benefits**:
- +40-60% quality improvement (specialists > generalist)
- Better verification (each agent expert in their domain)
- Clear responsibility (each agent owns their phases)

**Read**: `prompts/multi-agent/README.md` for detailed orchestration guide.

## 📈 Observability with LangFuse

### Track Every Decision & Optimize Costs

**LangFuse** gives you complete visibility:
- Cost per phase (which phases are expensive?)
- Token usage per tool call
- Time per phase
- Verification success rates
- Error/retry patterns

### Quick Setup

1. **Install**: `npm install langfuse`
2. **Configure**: Add keys to `.env.local`
3. **Use**: Wrap planning session in trace

**Read**: `integrations/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` for detailed setup.
