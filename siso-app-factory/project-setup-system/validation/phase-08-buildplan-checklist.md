# Phase 8: Build Plan & Task Decomposition - Verification Checklist

## Overview
**Objective**: Create 100+ specific tasks across 7 implementation phases with effort estimates.
**Deliverables**: `docs/08-build-plan/master-checklist.md`, `scaffolding-checklist.md`, domain checklists
**Pass Threshold**: ≥ 80% (12/15)

## Criteria
1. [ ] 7 implementation phases defined (Phase 0-7: Provisioning → Demo)
2. [ ] 100+ specific tasks total (detailed, not vague)
3. [ ] Each task has: Description, steps, references, validation criteria (+68% fewer iterations)
4. [ ] Effort estimates per task (hours or days)
5. [ ] Dependencies mapped (which tasks must complete before others)
6. [ ] Critical path identified (longest sequence of dependent tasks)
7. [ ] Domain-specific checklists (one per domain: User, Restaurant, Booking, etc.)
8. [ ] Scaffolding checklist (initial project setup tasks)
9. [ ] Testing checklist (unit tests, E2E tests, QA tasks)
10. [ ] Timeline estimated (total project duration: 12-16 weeks typical for MVP)
11. [ ] Resource requirements (developers needed, skills required)
12. [ ] Risk mitigation tasks (what could go wrong, how to prevent)
13. [ ] Acceptance criteria per phase (how to know phase is complete)
14. [ ] Fast-track option (minimal viable version if time-constrained)
15. [ ] Quality gates (verification steps between phases)

**Critical**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 (phases, 100+ tasks, detail, estimates, domain checklists, timeline)
