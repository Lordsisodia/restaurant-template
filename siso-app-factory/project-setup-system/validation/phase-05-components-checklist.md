# Phase 5: Page & Component Planning - Verification Checklist

## Overview
**Objective**: Map all pages, identify components, achieve 85%+ library reuse.
**Deliverables**: `docs/05-technical/component-catalog.md`, `theme-tokens.md`, `siso-site-config.yaml`
**Pass Threshold**: â‰¥ 80% (12/15)

## Criteria
1. [ ] Complete page inventory (public, authenticated, admin pages) - 20-30 pages
2. [ ] Each page has component list (Header, Hero, Form, Footer, etc.)
3. [ ] Component library searched FIRST (siso-app-factory packages)
4. [ ] 85%+ components from library (NOT custom builds)
5. [ ] Custom components justified (why library doesn't have this)
6. [ ] Component catalog created (all components listed with descriptions)
7. [ ] Shared components identified (used across multiple pages)
8. [ ] Design tokens defined (colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, radii)
9. [ ] Theme configuration created (siso-site-config.yaml)
10. [ ] Component variants documented (e.g., Button: primary, secondary, ghost)
11. [ ] Responsive behavior noted (mobile vs desktop layouts)
12. [ ] Component states defined (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
13. [ ] Accessibility considerations (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, contrast)
14. [ ] Component props documented (what data each component needs)
15. [ ] Page-to-component mapping complete (clear which components on which pages)

**Critical**: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 (pages have components, 85%+ reuse, shared identified, tokens, config)
