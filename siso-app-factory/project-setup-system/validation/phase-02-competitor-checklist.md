## Overview
**Objective**: Deep audit of 10-15 competitors to extract 50+ features and identify gaps.
**Deliverables**: `docs/02-competitor-analysis/feature-matrix.md`, competitor screenshots, notes

- [ ] Screenshots show: Homepage, booking flow, unique features
- [ ] Organized in `competitor-screenshots/[competitor-name]/`

### 5. Feature Prioritization Evidence
- [ ] For each feature: % of competitors that have it
- [ ] Must-Have: 80%+ have it
- [ ] Should-Have: 40-79% have it
- [ ] Nice-to-Have: 10-39% have it
- [ ] Unique: <10% have it (differentiation opportunities)
