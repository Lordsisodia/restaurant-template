# Phase 4: Architecture Design - Verification Checklist

## Overview
**Objective**: Define domains, tech stack, multi-tenancy model, security architecture.
**Deliverables**: `docs/05-technical/architecture.md`, `tech-stack.md`, domain plans
**Pass Threshold**: â‰¥ 80% (12/15)

## Criteria
1. [ ] 10-20 business domains identified (User, Restaurant, Booking, etc.)
2. [ ] Domain boundaries clear (responsibilities, entities, dependencies)
3. [ ] Tech stack chosen with rationale (Next.js, Supabase, Clerk, Stripe)
4. [ ] Multi-tenancy model defined (shared DB with RLS vs separate DBs)
5. [ ] Security architecture (auth, authorization, RBAC roles)
6. [ ] Data architecture overview (tables, relationships, RLS policies)
7. [ ] Integration architecture (Stripe, Clerk, email, SMS)
8. [ ] Performance requirements (page load < 2s, API < 500ms)
9. [ ] Scalability plan (concurrent users, auto-scaling)
10. [ ] Architecture diagrams (C4 or Mermaid: Context, Container)
11. [ ] Design decisions documented (ADRs for key choices)
12. [ ] Trade-offs acknowledged (chosen approach vs alternatives)
13. [ ] Tech stack comparison table (Firebase vs Supabase, etc.)
14. [ ] Cost estimates (infrastructure per 100 tenants)
15. [ ] Deployment strategy (Vercel, environments, CI/CD)

**Critical**: 1, 3, 4, 5, 10 (domains, tech stack, multi-tenancy, security, diagrams)
