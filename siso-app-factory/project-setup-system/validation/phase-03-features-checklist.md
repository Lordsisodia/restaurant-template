# Phase 3: Feature Planning - Verification Checklist

## Overview
**Objective**: Consolidate 50+ features, prioritize using evidence, define MVP scope.
**Deliverables**: `docs/03-features/features.md`, `feature-priority-matrix.md`, `user-journeys.md`
**Pass Threshold**: â‰¥ 80% (12/15 criteria)

## Critical Criteria

### 1. 50+ Features Compiled
- [ ] 50+ unique features from Phase 2 research
- [ ] No duplicates (features deduplicated and merged)

### 2. Evidence-Based Prioritization
- [ ] Must-Have (80%+ competitors): 15-25 features
- [ ] Should-Have (40-79% competitors): 10-15 features
- [ ] Nice-to-Have (10-39% competitors): 10-15 features
- [ ] Unique (<10% competitors): 5-10 features

### 3. MVP Defined
- [ ] MVP scope: 20-30 Must-Have features
- [ ] MVP excludes Should-Have and Nice-to-Have (Phase 2+)
- [ ] Rationale for each MVP feature (why critical)

### 4. User Stories
- [ ] Each MVP feature has user story: "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
- [ ] User stories are specific and measurable

### 5. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each MVP feature has acceptance criteria (how to know it works)
- [ ] Criteria are measurable (e.g., "Search returns results in < 500ms")

### 6. Feature Dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies mapped (Feature A requires Feature B to be built first)
- [ ] Build order suggested based on dependencies

### 7. User Journeys Mapped
- [ ] Primary user journey (guest booking flow): 5-8 steps
- [ ] Secondary journey (returning user): 3-5 steps
- [ ] Admin journey (restaurant managing bookings): 4-6 steps

### 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance targets (page load, API response)
- [ ] Scalability targets (concurrent users, bookings/month)
- [ ] Availability target (uptime %)

### 9. Feature Exclusions Documented
- [ ] 10+ features explicitly marked as NOT in MVP
- [ ] Reason for each exclusion (why not now)

### 10. Success Metrics
- [ ] For each MVP feature: Success metric defined
- [ ] Example: "Booking feature = 70% completion rate, < 5 min avg time"

## Pass Criteria: 12/15 (80%)

**Critical**: Must pass 1, 2, 3, 4 (features compiled, prioritized, MVP defined, user stories)
