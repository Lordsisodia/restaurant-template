- [ ] Each non-goal has a reason WHY it's out of scope

**Evidence Required**:
```
## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Explicitly NOT Building (MVP)
‚ùå **Food delivery/takeout ordering** - Reason: Different business model, requires logistics
‚ùå **Payment processing for meals** - Reason: Only reservation deposits in scope
‚ùå **Restaurant POS integration** - Reason: Too complex for MVP, manual confirmation ok
‚ùå **Waitlist management** - Reason: Fixed-time reservations only initially
‚ùå **Customer loyalty programs** - Reason: Nice-to-have, not core booking flow
‚ùå **Multi-language beyond EN/ID** - Reason: Covers 95% of users, others can use translate
‚ùå **Table layout visualization** - Reason: Not critical to booking success
‚ùå **Review/rating system** - Reason: Not competing with Google/TripAdvisor
‚ùå **Group bookings >10 people** - Reason: <5% of bookings, edge case
‚ùå **Restaurant analytics dashboard** - Reason: Phase 2 feature, basic reports ok for MVP
[... 10+ items ...]

### Future Consideration (Phase 2+)
üîÆ **Table layout visualization** (Phase 2, Weeks 13-16)
üîÆ **WhatsApp booking bot** (Phase 2, Weeks 17-20)

üîÆ **Google Calendar sync** (Phase 3)
üîÆ **Multi-location management for chains** (Phase 3)
[... 5+ items ...]

### Never Building
üö´ **Restaurant review platform** - Reason: Google/TripAdvisor own this space
üö´ **Restaurant supply chain** - Reason: Completely different business
üö´ **Catering/event management** - Reason: Separate product line
[... 3+ items ...]
```

**Pass Criteria**: 18+ total (10 ‚ùå + 5 üîÆ + 3 üö´) with reasons

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå No non-goals section (everything is in scope?)

**Evidence Required**:
```
## Alternatives Considered

### Tech Stack Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Firebase instead of Supabase
**Pros**:
- More mature, larger community
- Better real-time database
- Google Cloud integration

**Cons**:
- 10x more expensive at scale (100K users)
- Vendor lock-in (harder to migrate off Google)
- No Postgres (we need relational joins for multi-tenant)

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Chose Supabase for cost + Postgres + open-source

---

#### Alternative 2: Build custom auth instead of Clerk
**Pros**:
- Full control over auth logic
- No monthly recurring cost

**Cons**:
- 3-4 weeks additional dev time
- Security risks (not auth experts)
- Ongoing maintenance burden

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Chose Clerk for speed + security

[... 3+ tech stack alternatives ...]

### Architecture Alternatives

#### Multi-Instance (Separate DB per Tenant) vs Shared DB with RLS
**Multi-Instance Pros**:
- True data isolation
- Easier to scale huge tenants

**Multi-Instance Cons**:
- 100 tenants = 100 DBs ($5K/month infrastructure)
- Complex provisioning
- Harder cross-tenant analytics

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Chose shared DB with RLS for simplicity at MVP scale (<100 tenants)
**Revisit Criteria**: If we reach 50+ tenants or see performance issues

[... 2+ architecture alternatives ...]

### Feature Alternatives

#### Email vs SMS vs Both for confirmations
**Options**: A) Email only, B) SMS only, C) Both (user chooses)

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Option C (both, user preference)
**Rationale**:
- SMS has 95% open rate in Indonesia (vs 20% email)
- Email preferred by business users for records
- Marginal cost ($0.01 SMS vs $0.001 email)

[... 2+ feature alternatives ...]
```

**Pass Criteria**: 7+ alternatives (3+2+2) with full pros/cons/decision

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå No alternatives considered (didn't explore options)
- ‚ùå Strawman alternatives (obviously bad options to make choice look good)
- ‚ùå Missing rationale (decision unclear)

- Run spellcheck: 0 errors
- Jargon check: Technical terms defined in glossary
- Terminology consistency: Search for "reservation" if using "booking" ‚Üí replace all

**Pass Criteria**: All 5 checkboxes ‚úÖ

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå Typos, grammar errors (looks unprofessional)
- ‚ùå Overly complex sentences (hard to understand)
- ‚ùå Undefined acronyms (RLS, WCAG, etc. without explanation)

[... all research sources ...]
```

**Pass Criteria**: 9/9 phases referenced

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå No references (can't verify claims)
- ‚ùå Missing phase references (PDR should consolidate all phases)

---

### Criterion 18: Stakeholder-Ready

**Description**: PDR can be shared with stakeholders, investors, customers without modification.

**How to Verify**:
- [ ] No internal-only information (no "secret" roadmap items, no employee names unless appropriate)
- [ ] Professional tone (no casual language like "pretty cool feature")
- [ ] Visually appealing (use of tables, diagrams, formatting)
- [ ] Confident but honest (acknowledge risks, don't oversell)
- [ ] Approvals documented (decision maker signed off)

**Evidence Required**:
- Read-through test: Would you send this to an investor? (Yes ‚Üí Pass)
- Tone check: No "lol", "btw", "kinda", etc.
- Visual check: Diagrams, tables break up text
- Honesty check: Risks acknowledged, not hidden

Document includes approval section:
```
## Document Approval

| Role | Name | Date | Signature |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Product Owner | [Name] | 2025-04-15 | ‚úÖ Approved |
| Tech Lead | [Name] | 2025-04-15 | ‚úÖ Approved |
| Stakeholder | [Name] | 2025-04-16 | ‚úÖ Approved |
```

**Pass Criteria**: All 5 checkboxes ‚úÖ

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå Too casual ("This app is gonna be sick!")
- ‚ùå Internal jargon (employee names, project codenames)
- ‚ùå Overpromising (no risk acknowledgment)

---

## COMPLETENESS CHECK

### Criterion 19: Buildable by Developers

**Description**: Developers can start implementing based on this PDR alone.

**How to Verify**:
- [ ] All features defined with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Architecture clear (developers know which tech to use)
- [ ] Database schema referenced (developers know data model)
- [ ] Component catalog referenced (developers know UI components)
- [ ] Build plan referenced (developers know order of implementation)
- [ ] No critical decisions left unmade (e.g., "TBD: Choose payment gateway")

**Evidence Required**:
Test: Give PDR to a developer unfamiliar with the project
- Can they answer: "What am I building?" ‚úÖ
- Can they answer: "What tech stack?" ‚úÖ
- Can they answer: "What features in MVP?" ‚úÖ
- Can they answer: "What does success look like?" ‚úÖ
- Can they start coding without asking 10 questions? ‚úÖ

**Pass Criteria**: All 6 checkboxes ‚úÖ

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå Too high-level (developers need to guess implementation)
- ‚ùå Missing technical details (no tech stack, no schema)
- ‚ùå Undefined features (vague requirements)

---

### Criterion 20: Testable & Measurable

**Description**: QA can create test plans, stakeholders can measure success.

**How to Verify**:
- [ ] Each feature has success criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined (how to know if feature works)
- [ ] Performance targets stated (page load < 2s, API < 500ms)
- [ ] Success metrics defined (50 customers, 5% churn, NPS > 50)
- [ ] Non-functional requirements clear (accessibility, security, scalability)

**Evidence Required**:
```
## Success Criteria Examples

Feature: Restaurant Search
- Success Criteria: Results return in < 500ms, 95% relevance

Feature: Booking Confirmation
- Success Criteria: Email sent within 30s of booking, 98% deliverability

Performance Targets:
- Page load time: < 2s (Lighthouse score > 90)
- API response time: < 500ms (p95)
- Database queries: < 100ms (p95)

Business Metrics (12 months):
- 500 paying tenants
- $20K MRR
- NPS > 50
- Churn < 5%/month
```

**Pass Criteria**: All 5 checkboxes ‚úÖ

**Common Failures**:
- ‚ùå Vague success ("Feature works well")
- ‚ùå No performance targets (how fast is fast enough?)
- ‚ùå No business metrics (how do we know if we succeeded?)

## Scoring

### Calculation
```
Score = (Criteria Passed / 20) √ó 100%
```

### Pass/Fail Thresholds

| Score | Decision | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 95-100% (19-20/20) | EXCELLENT | Proceed immediately, celebrate! |
| 90-94% (18/20) | PASS | Proceed to implementation |
| 80-89% (16-17/20) | RETRY | Fix gaps, PDR is foundation for all work |
| < 80% (< 16/20) | FAIL | Major rework, PDR not ready |

**Highest threshold (90%) because PDR is the final deliverable that consolidates all 8 previous phases.**

### Critical Criteria (Must Pass)

Even if overall score is 90%, failing these means RETRY:

- ‚úÖ Criterion 1: Press Release complete
- ‚úÖ Criterion 7: Features comprehensively documented
- ‚úÖ Criterion 11: All 13 sections present
- ‚úÖ Criterion 12: No [TBD] placeholders
- ‚úÖ Criterion 19: Buildable by developers

**Rationale**: Without these, PDR is incomplete and cannot serve as foundation for implementation.

## Integration with LangFuse

```javascript
const verification = trace.span({
  name: 'Verification: Phase 9 - PDR',
  input: { phase: 9, criteria: 20, finalDeliverable: true }
});

const results = {
  passed: 19,
  failed: 1,
  score: 19/20,
  criticalPassed: true,
  ready_for_implementation: true,
  checks: [
    { criterion: 'Press Release complete', result: 'PASS', evidence: 'Customer quote, FAQ included' },
    { criterion: 'Assumptions documented', result: 'PASS', evidence: '32 assumptions (10+10+7+5)' },
    // ... all 20 criteria ...
  ]
};

verification.end({
  output: results,
  level: results.score >= 0.9 ? 'DEFAULT' : 'WARNING'
});

// If PDR passes, mark entire planning phase complete
if (results.ready_for_implementation) {
  trace.update({
    output: { phase: 'PLANNING_COMPLETE', ready_to_build: true },
    tags: ['pdr-approved', 'ready-for-dev']
  });
}
