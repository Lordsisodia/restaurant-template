## Implications for Product

Based on this research, we recommend:

1. Mobile-First Design

## Scoring

### Calculation
```
Score = (Criteria Passed / 15) × 100%
```

### Pass/Fail Thresholds

| Score | Decision | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 90-100% (14-15/15) | EXCELLENT | Proceed immediately |
| 80-89% (12-13/15) | PASS | Proceed (note minor gaps) |
| 60-79% (9-11/15) | RETRY | Fix critical gaps, re-verify |
| < 60% (< 9/15) | FAIL | Major rework, reconsider approach |

### Critical Criteria (Must Pass)

These criteria are **non-negotiable** - even if overall score is 80%, failing these means RETRY:

- ✅ Criterion 1: Market size quantified
- ✅ Criterion 3: 10+ sources cited
- ✅ Criterion 5: Consumer behavior data

**Rationale**: Without market size, sources, and user data, all subsequent planning is guesswork.
