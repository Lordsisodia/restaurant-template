## 6. Alternatives Considered

> **Purpose**: Document WHY we chose this approach over others. Future team members (or yourself) will ask "Why didn't we use X?" This section answers it permanently.

### Tech Stack Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: [Technology Option 1] instead of [Chosen Technology]

**Option**: Use [Alternative Tech] instead of [Chosen Tech]

**Pros**:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

**Cons**:
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]
- [Drawback 3]

**Decision**: ✅ Chose [Chosen Tech] because [primary reason]

**Examples:**

#### Alternative 1: Firebase instead of Supabase

**Pros**:
- More mature product, larger community
- Better real-time database performance
- Tight Google Cloud integration
- Better mobile SDK support

**Cons**:
- 10x more expensive at scale (100K users)
- Vendor lock-in (harder to migrate off Google)
- No native Postgres (we need relational joins for multi-tenant queries)
- Firestore data model doesn't match our relational needs

**Decision**: ✅ Chose Supabase for cost efficiency, Postgres compatibility, and open-source flexibility

---

#### Alternative 2: Build custom authentication instead of Clerk

**Pros**:
- Full control over auth logic
- No monthly recurring cost
- Can customize any feature we want

**Cons**:
- 3-4 weeks additional dev time
- Security risks (we're not auth experts)
- Ongoing maintenance burden (password resets, MFA, etc.)
- No proven track record at scale

**Decision**: ✅ Chose Clerk for speed-to-market, proven security, and lower long-term risk

---

### Architecture Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Multi-Instance Architecture (Separate DB per Tenant)

**Approach**: Each restaurant gets their own database instance

**Pros**:
- True data isolation (no risk of cross-tenant data leaks)
- Easier to scale huge tenants independently
- Can customize schema per tenant if needed

**Cons**:
- Database provisioning complexity (100 tenants = 100 databases)
- Higher infrastructure costs ($50/month per DB × 100 = $5K/month)
- Harder to do cross-tenant analytics
- Migration complexity when schema changes

**Decision**: ✅ Chose shared database with RLS for simplicity and cost at MVP scale (< 100 tenants)

**Revisit Criteria**: If we reach 50+ tenants or see performance issues, reconsider multi-instance

---

#### Alternative 2: Monolithic Application instead of Domain-Driven Design

**Approach**: Single Next.js app with all features in one codebase, no domain separation

**Pros**:
- Simpler initially (fewer files, less abstraction)
- Faster to build first version
- Easier for solo developer to navigate

**Cons**:
- Harder to maintain beyond 50K LOC
- Can't split domains to separate teams later
- Difficult to test features in isolation
- Merge conflicts increase as team grows

**Decision**: ✅ Chose domain-driven design for long-term scalability and team growth

**Rationale**: We're planning to scale to 5+ developers within 12 months, DDD provides clear boundaries

---

### Feature Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Email Confirmations vs SMS Confirmations

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Email-only confirmations
- Option B: SMS-only confirmations
- Option C: Both email and SMS (user chooses)

**Decision**: ✅ Option C (both, user chooses preference)

**Rationale**:
- Indonesian users heavily use SMS (high open rate ~95%)
- Email preferred by business users for records
- Marginal cost difference ($0.01 SMS vs $0.001 email negligible)
- Better user experience with choice

## 9. Multi-Tenancy & Cost Strategy

### Multi-Tenancy Model

**Architecture**: [Shared Database with RLS / Separate DB per Tenant / Hybrid]

**Implementation**:
- **Tenant Isolation**: `tenant_id` column on all multi-tenant tables
- **RLS Policies**: Enforce tenant isolation at database level
- **Domain Model**: Each restaurant = 1 tenant
- **Admin Separation**: Super-admin panel operates above tenant boundary

**Tenant Onboarding**:
1. Restaurant signs up → Create tenant record
2. Provision database schemas (automatic via RLS)
3. Generate tenant-specific subdomain: `[restaurant-slug].tablemaster.id`
4. Configure theme/branding via `siso-site-config.yaml`
5. Import initial data (menu, hours, seating capacity)

**Tenant Limits** (to prevent abuse):

| Resource | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Enterprise |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Bookings/month | 100 | 1,000 | Unlimited |
| Staff users | 2 | 10 | Unlimited |
| API calls/day | 1,000 | 10,000 | Custom |
| Storage | 100 MB | 1 GB | Custom |

### Cost Structure

**Infrastructure Costs** (Estimated per 100 tenants):

| Service | Tier | Monthly Cost | Per Tenant |
|---------|------|--------------|------------|
| Supabase | Pro | $25 | $0.25 |
| Vercel | Pro | $20 | $0.20 |
| Clerk | Pro | $25 | $0.25 |
| Stripe | Pay-as-you-go | ~$50 | $0.50 |
| SendGrid | Essentials | $15 | $0.15 |
| **Total** | | **$135** | **$1.35/tenant** |

**Variable Costs**:
- SMS notifications: $0.01 per message (opt-in only)
- Transaction fees: Stripe 2.9% + $0.30 per booking deposit
- Overage bandwidth: $0.10/GB beyond included tier

**Revenue Model**:

| Tier | Price/Month | Features | Target Segment |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Free | $0 | 100 bookings, 2 staff | Small cafes, testing |
| Starter | Rp 299K (~$20) | 500 bookings, 5 staff | Small restaurants |
| Pro | Rp 599K (~$40) | 2,000 bookings, 15 staff | Medium restaurants |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited, white-label | Large chains |

**Unit Economics** (Pro Tier Example):
- Revenue: Rp 599K/month ($40)
- Infrastructure Cost: $1.35/tenant
- Support Cost (est): $2/tenant
- **Gross Margin**: ~90% ($36.65 profit per tenant)
