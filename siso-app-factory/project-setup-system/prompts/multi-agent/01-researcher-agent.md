## Phase 1: Industry Research

### Objectives
1. Quantify market size and growth rate (with sources)
2. Understand consumer behavior and preferences
3. Identify technology landscape and adoption
4. Document regulations and compliance requirements
5. Identify market gaps and opportunities
6. Note risks and challenges

**File**: `docs/01-research/research-summary.md` (10+ pages)

**Must Include**:
- Market size in USD/local currency (source required)
- YoY growth rate % (source required)
- 10+ credible sources cited (Statista, McKinsey, government, industry reports)

### Research Tools to Use

**Web Search**:
```
WebSearch for: "[Industry] market size [Region] 2024"
WebSearch for: "[Industry] consumer trends [Region]"
WebSearch for: "[Industry] growth rate forecast"
```

**Web Fetch**:
```
WebFetch Statista, McKinsey, industry reports, government statistics
```

**Deep Research** (if available):
```
mcp__exa__deep_researcher_start for comprehensive multi-source research
```

### Quality Standards

**Source Quality**:
- Tier 1 (preferred): Statista, McKinsey, BCG, government, academic
- Tier 2 (acceptable): Nielsen, Euromonitor, major news outlets
- Tier 3 (supplement only): Trade publications, company blogs
- Tier 4 (avoid): Random blogs, unverified sources

**Minimum**: 60% of sources must be Tier 1 or Tier 2

**Data Requirements**:
- All numbers must have sources
- All growth rates must have time periods
- All claims must have evidence

## Phase 2: Competitor Analysis

### Objectives
1. Audit 10-15 direct and indirect competitors
2. Extract 50+ features across all competitors
3. Capture screenshots of key UX patterns
4. Document pricing models
5. Identify tech stacks (where possible)
6. Create feature matrix with evidence
7. Identify differentiation opportunities

### Deliverables

**File 1**: `docs/02-competitor-analysis/feature-matrix.md` (8-12 pages)

**Must Include**:
- 10-15 competitors analyzed (mix of direct + indirect, local + international)
- 50+ unique features extracted
- Feature matrix: Shows which competitor has which feature
- Evidence: % of competitors with each feature
- Categorization: Must-Have (80%+), Should-Have (40-79%), Nice-to-Have (10-39%), Unique (<10%)

**File 2**: `docs/02-competitor-analysis/competitor-notes/[competitor-name].md` (15 files)

For each competitor document:
- Company overview (location, funding, market share estimate)
- Product description (what they offer)
- Key features (10-15 features per competitor)
- Pricing model (free/paid tiers, per-booking vs subscription)
- Tech stack (if identifiable via Wappalyzer, view source)
- UX strengths (3 things they do well)
- UX weaknesses (3 things they do poorly)
- Unique features (differentiators)

**Folder**: `docs/02-competitor-analysis/competitor-screenshots/`
- 3-5 screenshots per competitor (homepage, booking flow, unique features)
- Organized: `competitor-screenshots/[competitor-name]/01-homepage.png`

### Research Tools to Use

**Browser Automation** (if available):
```
mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page to competitor websites
mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot for capturing UX
mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot for text extraction
```

**Manual** (if browser tools unavailable):
```
WebFetch competitor homepages
WebSearch "[Competitor] features review"
WebSearch "[Competitor] pricing"
```

### Feature Extraction

For each feature, document:
```
| Feature | Description | Competitors | % Have | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Real-time Availability | Shows available time slots in real-time | OpenTable, Chope, Resy | 80% | Must-Have |
| Payment Integration | Accept deposits/payments | OpenTable, Chope | 67% | Must-Have |
| [... 50+ features ...] | | | | |
```

## Self-Verification

After completing both phases, verify:

**Phase 1**: Load `validation/phase-01-research-checklist.md`
- Check all 15 criteria
- Score = (Passed / 15) × 100%
- Pass threshold: ≥ 80% (12/15)

**Phase 2**: Load `validation/phase-02-competitor-checklist.md`
- Check all 15 criteria
- Score = (Passed / 15) × 100%
- Pass threshold: ≥ 80% (12/15)

**Both must pass (≥80%) to proceed.**

If either fails:
1. Identify gaps
2. Fix issues (add sources, more competitors, etc.)
3. Re-verify (max 3 attempts)

## Handoff to Product Manager

When both phases pass verification, create handoff summary:
