## 🚀 How to Use During Planning

### Before Starting a Planning Session

```bash
# 1. Initialize tracking
node tools/langfuse-init.js "Restaurant Booking App" "restaurant" "Indonesia"

# You'll see:
# ✅ LangFuse trace created successfully!
# Trace ID: abc-123-xyz
# View at: https://cloud.langfuse.com/traces/abc-123-xyz
```

This creates a trace and saves the trace ID to `.langfuse-trace.json`.

### During Planning (Tell Claude)

```
"I want to plan a restaurant booking app for Indonesia.

TRACKING SETUP:
- LangFuse is already initialized (trace saved in .langfuse-trace.json)
- For each phase you complete, log it using:

  node tools/langfuse-track-phase.js <phase> <duration> <tokens> <cost> <score>

Examples:
  node tools/langfuse-track-phase.js 1 "12 minutes" 18500 0.47 95
  node tools/langfuse-track-phase.js 4.5 "38 minutes" 28000 0.76 90
  node tools/langfuse-track-phase.js 9 "22 minutes" 12000 0.34 97

NOW START PLANNING:
Follow MASTER-SETUP-PROMPT.md with all 9 phases + Phase 4.5 UI/UX Design.
Use multi-agent orchestration for best results.
Verify after each phase using validation/ checklists."
```

### After Planning Complete

```bash
# Finalize the trace
node tools/langfuse-finish.js

# You'll see:
# ✅ Trace finalized successfully!
# View at: https://cloud.langfuse.com/traces/[your-trace-id]
```

## 📈 What Gets Tracked

### Automatically Tracked

When you run the scripts above, LangFuse captures:

**Per Phase**:
- Phase name (e.g., "Phase 4.5: UI/UX Design")
- Duration (e.g., "38 minutes")
- Tokens used (e.g., 28,000)
- Estimated cost (e.g., $0.76)
- Verification score (e.g., 90%)
- Pass/fail status

**Overall Session**:
- Total duration (e.g., 6.5 hours)
- Total tokens (e.g., 235,000)
- Total cost (e.g., $5.12)
- All 9 phases in timeline
- Verification success rates

### What You'll Learn

**Cost Insights**:
```
"Phase 4 (Architecture) costs $1.23 (24% of total)"
→ Action: Optimize architecture prompts to reduce tokens
```

**Performance Insights**:
```
"Phase 6 (Domain Ops) takes 42 minutes (slowest)"
→ Action: Provide domain examples to speed this up
```

**Quality Insights**:
```
"Phase 4.5 (UI/UX) failed verification first try (85% score)"
→ Action: UI checklist might be too strict, or need better examples
```

## 🎬 Real Planning Session Example

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# STEP 1: Initialize tracking
node tools/langfuse-init.js "Restaurant Booking App" "restaurant" "Indonesia"

# STEP 2: Open dashboard in browser (to watch in real-time)
open https://cloud.langfuse.com

# Tell Claude the prompt from above (with tracking instructions)

# STEP 4: Claude completes planning (6-8 hours)
# Claude runs: node tools/langfuse-track-phase.js after each phase
# You see phases appearing in LangFuse dashboard in real-time!

# STEP 5: Finalize trace
node tools/langfuse-finish.js

# STEP 6: Review results in dashboard

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Watch in Real-Time

Keep LangFuse dashboard open in a browser tab while Claude is planning:

```bash
# Open dashboard
open https://cloud.langfuse.com

# Leave it open, refresh periodically
# Watch phases appear as Claude completes them!
```

### Tip 2: Compare Projects

After planning 2-3 projects, compare them:

1. Go to "Traces"
2. Filter by tag (e.g., "restaurant" vs "tour-guide")
3. Compare:
   - Which industry takes longer to plan?
   - Which industry costs more?
   - Which phases are consistent vs variable?

### Tip 3: Optimize Based on Data

After 5 projects, analyze patterns:

```
Pattern Found:
"Phase 2 (Competitors) always costs $0.60-0.80
 but Phase 4 (Architecture) varies widely: $0.90-1.50"

Hypothesis: Architecture phase depends on complexity
Action: For simple apps, provide architecture templates to speed up
```

### Tip 4: Set Cost Budgets

Free tier limits: 50K events/month

Typical planning session: ~100 events (9 phases + spans + verifications)

**You can track ~500 planning sessions/month on free tier** (way more than needed!)

If you exceed:
- Upgrade to paid tier ($20/month for 500K events)
- Or optimize to reduce events (batch smaller logs)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my trace in the dashboard"

**Solution**:
1. Wait 5-10 seconds (LangFuse batches uploads)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if script ran successfully (should say "Data sent to LangFuse")
4. If still missing, check internet connection

### "Cost shows $0.00"

**Reason**: Cost calculation is manual (you provide it when calling `langfuse-track-phase.js`)

**How to get actual cost**:
1. Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing:
   - Input tokens: $3 per 1M tokens
   - Output tokens: $15 per 1M tokens

2. Estimate:
   ```
   Phase 1 uses ~18K tokens
   Assume 50/50 input/output:
   - Input: 9K × $0.000003 = $0.027
   - Output: 9K × $0.000015 = $0.135
   - Total: ~$0.16 (we estimated $0.47, may be high)
   ```

3. For more accurate tracking:
   - Use Claude API directly (get exact token counts)
   - Or use conservative estimates and adjust

### "Trace ID lost"

**Solution**:
- Trace ID saved in `.langfuse-trace.json`
- If lost, check that file
- Or go to dashboard → Traces → Find by project name

## 📝 Manual Tracking (If Scripts Don't Work)

If helper scripts have issues, track manually:

```javascript
import { Langfuse } from "langfuse";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });

const langfuse = new Langfuse({
  publicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
  baseUrl: process.env.LANGFUSE_HOST,
});

// Create trace
const trace = langfuse.trace({
  name: 'SISO Planning: Restaurant App',
  userId: 'shaan@siso.com',
});

// Track phase
const phase1 = trace.span({ name: 'Phase 1: Research' });
// ... do work ...
phase1.end({
  output: { files: ['research-summary.md'] },
  metadata: { duration: '12m', tokens: 18500, cost: 0.47, score: 95 }
});

// Flush
await langfuse.shutdownAsync();
```
