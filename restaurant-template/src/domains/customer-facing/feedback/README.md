Probably, it depends also, like, you know, the owner concept, but for me, like, it's not like it's too much color, and then it is too much color, yeah, and then we can't focus on that, you know, the font, like the words, so like too much might be the background taking too much of the so would you rather have the hero section or maybe the background image? So I get it, there's too much stuff going on, yes, yes, yes, too much stuff going on. And what do we want to highlight? Do we like the hero or do we like the images more? So we could have, so we either have no image on the background and just this rotating, which I don't think is good, or just like a set hero that doesn't change and but then the images change, yeah, it's better like that. Would be like just the words but like, um, the color is starting like not changed the background on the back is fine and then we we don't maybe like more more like uh yeah the saturation or what it's called uh it's more black yeah like uh more shade or something i i think i oh so like there's like a transparency yeah okay i see and then um for now few menu okay see this order now when you click that should just take you to grab oh no it takes you to the group view the view the menu which it shouldn't really do to be fair I think we have them or maybe we get rid of them because look you can go order now here and then view menu you can view it here Or what option is it put there View menu or Yeah menu is view menu and then Because we could just have one, one in the middle view menu. Which, what is the? It's already menu there. So close it. View order now, view menu. One second. So when you click the order now it takes you to the menu one right now because it's on the dev it would be slow just click it there you go it should take you okay order online the order online goes to the grab probably and that is also whatsapp yeah yeah there's whatsapp at the bottom here just leave it like that yeah and then what's the next one okay and then this one like specialty drinks highlights and stuff like that yeah this is nice okay yeah so we'll keep this uh the what what the guests say the testimonials uh what what you not like about this maybe some of these are too long okay i guess but no it's fine yeah yeah okay our story um obviously we can just have different like nice images from the company's thing what you not like about this or this is okay this is nice yeah follow us on Instagram we've got maybe some Instagram images yeah and then that's the name of the Instagram at the top yeah yeah maybe we only have it for images and for more images it slides across like this so it doesn't take up all six okay this is like a gallery do we need this this is like uh yeah that's that's yeah we need that yeah a lot of people want to see like um you know the gallery okay sweet and then location stuff yeah we know we need that yeah what's uh and then this information is quite important yeah that's important yeah that's nice on iphone yeah yep yep and then the footer what do we think about the which one? this whole thing, this section is the footer this is nice yeah we need to put that by sister yeah once I make our website, when they click this, it will go to the website yeah, we need that so when you click chat now, it will go to the whatsapp web but I don't have their whatsapp link, I don't have their grab link, so it's not connected right now yes yes i do have their instagram so yeah let's see if it actually okay i've got the wrong profile url so i need to fix that yeah just 


Right, we're getting feedback for the menu page now. Menu page, we need to get rid of this second category thing. I'm not sure why that's there. Also, the top hero section's a bit shit. I think I'm probably gonna get rid of this. Maybe we keep the order online and put it somewhere else, but I think this got added and I'm not sure why. So maybe if when you just go on the menu, it just goes on here. Yeah, okay, then I'm gonna get rid of this. This is extra, but then this is what I needed help with. Uh, this one it's like all the categories, but so this one is all the categories. This is the exact same thing, but it's added it twice, different ones. I don't know, I might have added in one of the templates for some reason. Which one do you like more? You like this one or like this one? Yeah, I prefer this one. Yeah, yeah. So when they click, you just need to choose that. Yeah, and then just put one there. Maybe yeah, yeah. I accidentally added two. Okay, so this is what I need to help with for the cards. Obviously, we'll have the real image. What information should we have on the cards? So there's only the ah, we should put the price as well. Yeah, yeah, it did have the price. I don't know what happened. But it needs to have the price. Maybe if it's a best seller or if it's new. Yeah, um, down here, do you think uh, usually they put like a vegetarian or vegetarian allergen information as well like uh spicy or maybe like a seafood options like that. Okay, so maybe like spicy category, how spicy it is. Should we also maybe put calories and macros on there as well? Uh, it depends on the like the restaurants. I mean like if they said like a healthy restaurant, they need it, but more like you know like only like you know coffee shop like that. No, they don't really care. Okay, and then obviously we need to slide sideways when it actually does do it so it's just cleaner. Uh, we need one more page for the we do have like promotion one the top one the first one right? Yeah, no, how about like um when they have like um a special event but only like every Saturday? Yeah, so let say like uh the website is running but every Saturday is pop-up. We can do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100. So like let's say like a promotion section. So like signature what would it what it cool is it cool promotion section or signature dishes like uh 20 off for this food and then uh 20 off for maybe like let's say like a Thursday night they have like okay, so we need like a nice promotion section which is always at the top and it changes out different different items. Okay, so how it works like we leave it like that for the whole day or is it anyway like it's only up here on Thursday? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bro. Whatever if you can, if you can, if you can think about it, bro, we can build it. Wow, it's like that. So even if you want it for happy hour, you want it only for or 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock? Yeah, we can have it pop up on them only the time? Yeah, oh that's nice like that. And then okay, so yeah we need the slideys to go down okay so that's everything on this but then let's click on the cards. Can you go in the top of this? Yeah this color? Yeah I feel like we just put it black or something. Yeah no I'm gonna get rid of this this got added extra. It was supposed to just be the it's just supposed to look like just that when it starts. I don't know why, as soon as you come I must have fucked around with it before and it breaks and stuff on this, obviously it's really shit right now. Oh it's a little bit better so when you click the menu it will be like this yeah so each of the items have their own page just for it maybe obviously we'll add some more images. What information should go on this page? Yeah so all the information that on the cards spicy allergen information maybe ingredients but that already on the card so we add it here but what this we can add some extra stuff like extra nice stuff because we have a whole page just for the one item so like I was thinking maybe chef's tip like you can order if you're ordering this definitely order a peach drink or something like that. Okay uh is it possible like um you know some menu like uh you know like a cappuccino they have a lot of option for the uh the syrup like they might be like butterscotch and then they have okay so customization options on there okay so like that would just be for drinks or food as well usually for drinks yeah okay okay so for drinks need to have customized options and then food sometimes they also only like the sauce and like um there's option for the sauce you know like when it's come to show all the sources they have like mushroom sauce black sauce yeah and then maybe different sides and stuff like that so they can pick from that yeah okay that's that's like the add-on you know like um uh when they order like um a steak maybe they want to add like another like you know sliced avocado or uh the add-ons like that. What about if we also have a section at at the bottom which is like this goes well with this and then we've got like a section at the bottom like good pairs or something like that? Oh yeah and then it shows the other things like say if you order I don't know I don't know what is a good pair but say you order a biscuit you should probably order a cappuccino as well you know something like that and we can have that connected so like a recommendation yeah yeah exactly like recommendations to pair up with it. Okay okay so So, I mean, actually I picked off the grid. What else can you think of? This is of course, when you maybe like a make, if you want a client who want to make like a hotel restaurant we need this nutrition And we can always take it out Just go we show on the demo everything we can do and then if they want to take stuff out fine we take it out if they want to add stuff fine we can add stuff what happened when they click this nothing that's just the category ah okay you want something to happen when we yeah I was thinking like uh it goes on to the category and shows all of the things when you like let's say like you're looking for a spaghetti and then when you click that the option on this pasta it appears like another spaghetti option or another pasta options like chini or so it takes you to a category page yeah all of the different categories okay so you know how we've got like a a par item page yeah and we've got the whole menu page yeah you're saying we should also have a category page so it's just a page just the past when when you just clicked it i mean like they go back to the category options but it's only for the oh it's a lot of i mean like it's too much so so what you're saying is it's like uh so we've got the whole menu page with everything as you just seen here it's the whole menu page this is just one item page but then you're saying in between that we have a category page so just pasta and it's like it's like this but with just the pasta options yeah so but what happened when you add also like um let's say like um it's a main course option and cross options and then there's also like um a lot of pasta options but we don't want the pasta options also that is a main course options i mean like when they click the main course there's the pasta options but when they want to have a look on another pasta they should go back to the main course which is more a lot of options how about like um they choose like from the main course and then they choose pasta they want to uh i mean like they choose the spaghetti let's say spaghetti bolognese and then we'll just explain there's like option on the top pasta and you click The pasta is only like pasta options. Yeah, not the whole menu. Oh, yeah, that's what I mean by category options. Yeah, it's like so when I say category, I mean like these categories. So like say I click on Breakfast it only shows the breakfast but it so that's me like the pasta option will be also add here. Yeah, I was thinking like, you know, like these drinks. Let's say like breakfast to Sherbert's over here. Can we make like, you know, oh, it's already done it look like like this so look I click on breakfast it only shows breakfast if I click on pasta it only shows pasta is that what you mean the I mean like this is like a sub option right? Yeah so people were like this is like when they click the categories like there is option for appetizer soup main course or dessert right? Yeah let's say like that yeah and then when they click the appetizer there will be like option for salad or what else what maybe soups and then when it open like they choose the main course there option for sticks or uh pizza all right so you want different categories so as well as these you've kind of got like starters main meal dessert drinks yes but when you click the main course options then we're like the subs uh sub options for like pasta pizza steak okay i understand what because when you share like this one is really complete but you know it's too complex yes so you would rather have like starters mains desserts desserts but when you drink but when you click the mains there's options for fosters so all these these are subcategories they go into the main okay that's smarter i didn't i didn't think of that um about our menu because yeah sometimes like when you click that maybe you will be you know like a bit confused no no i hear it's too much too much to look at i hear that and then we've got the unsure the ask ai assistant at the bottom takes it to that right let me just see 


Okay, it's for the reviews page. So yes, what do you think about this? For the title, it's good. Write the review. Yeah, you'll be able to write a review like it will be on Google Reviews or it no, it goes on this one. They'll have to. I can try and find a way to link it to Google Reviews, but I was thinking maybe when they write a review, we give them points, and then the points go on the membership like that, right? So I guess there's not too much to say on this. But what do you think about the UI? It's too boring, not good. It's good. It's simple. It's good. One moment, guest reviews. It's better if they can put it on Google Reviews. It's connected there. Okay, I'll see if I can because all the restaurants are really wanting to have a big Google Reviews. Yeah, so maybe we can do like uh okay fine. So it needs to link to Google Reviews, not this reviews. Okay, fine. Uh, for the cards for this, I don't really like it. How would you make these cards better? Do you think it's the color? The layout's okay. Maybe we add something else. Like, what do you think about this? Yeah, probably try like um no, it's it's good. Yeah, for me it's good. Yeah, probably like just the background of this. If you can make like a ball. Are you on black? No, brighter or bright or oh white. We can do we can do white. Okay, um or maybe depends on the theme of the websites that like oh yeah they do like a green olive then then it goes to like that. But then do you want it flipped like black background white card or do you want a black background dark green is nice. Yeah, okay, okay, yeah. It depends on the you know the theme of the restaurants. Yeah, so let's say like like this one, if you could see Draco is black and white, it's good. But you have a very good password by the way. Very safe password. What password? Your phone password. It's all zeros. Yes, very safe. I think I didn't get any that uh once again, Spetronas. So this one they have like a green color theme. Everything is green, green, green, green, green, green. This one that I want to uh also like uh make something for them, yeah, make something for them. So click the link tree. It's called All Greens. Click on one of the click the menu. What does it take? All right, we'll drive now. We need to put it on a website. Yeah, yeah, okay. All Greens. Okay, yeah, okay, yeah. So we'll we'll make it so that one will be all green on the background. It's depend on the restaurants uh obviously. It needs to add photos. Yes, yes. Photos. If you can like um, I think Google Review also like had some photos. It does. It does. I just haven't imported them over yet. Okay. So is that everything you think for the review section or what else do you think? Can we go on? So when you click the five stars, it's all the five stars that appear? Oh no, you have to go filters and then go five stars, but it's not connected. Okay, so the filtering needs to be... Oh no, it does work. It just shows a zero. Yeah, usually people will go for the first star. They click the first star. What's the bad? Oh, okay. Because they have so many five stars. You guys have like two one stars. I got rid of them. It's fine. Okay, yeah, just just make this same as the Google review. Okay, yeah, it's all so shoes and then yeah it's good. Yeah, okay, sweet. So is that everything for the reviews page you think or maybe images we like apart from images on here is there any images up here we should add or just clean like this just just clean. I need to check the other restaurants. 


Now we're working on the blog one. Obviously, I need to fix the gaps here. The gaps are a bit of shit, right? But then, on the filter by section, there's a lot of shit here. What do you think a better way is to do this? Maybe we have the drop down or scroll? This is for the filter. Yeah, to filter the blog types. Because this is too messy, right? Yeah, it's too much. So when you... I mean, this blog is for the SEO. Okay, we have like 25 blogs then yeah ranks on Google so it doesn't really matter too much how it looks. But obviously we just want to make it look clean. So maybe a drop-down or something like we did on the category section. Yeah, maybe like make it like more general or Yeah, okay, so we make it more general and then yeah, maybe also make it like a scroll or a drop-down. Can you go down? Yeah, so when you click this one and it's just so we're on the blog page now like like maybe we need like, what do you reckon, like better fonts, like title, subtitle, maybe bullet points or something. Oh, that's nice, little caption on the image. Yeah, that's nice. How long do you think each blog should be? Maybe like what, oh, that's good actually as well. Highlights, oh, this is nice. Didn't see that. How long do you think each blog should be? Maybe like, what's too long? This is definitely too short and it's bad formatting, but then like how would we? So this blog is like as you said for the SEO right? Yeah. It should be like picking up good topics yeah? Like what is special of this restaurant right. It more about you look at what has search traffic. When people are trying to look for coffee or whatever it just what's high search traffic. The thing about SEO is about you've got things of high search traffic, but then you've got a lot of competition for those maybe, right? So it's about which keywords have a good balance between being able to rank high and also have search traffic. So maybe, say we rank for 200 SEO words, um maybe we come up on the top page for for majority of those words right and then they see the draco blog or whatever it is so it might even be something completely nothing to do with coffee it might be what's the best beaches in bali maybe people are looking at that and then they'll be oh this is a cool blog let me look at this oh it just happens to be by draco and then maybe they check it out so it might not even be anything. I got it now. Okay, I was thinking like there's only like you know like I still about the restaurants and like we'll have a bunch about the restaurant yeah but like you can't have a hundred blogs about the restaurant you like we gotta do what's the best beaches we gotta do like maybe even what's the best locations to go to and then we also say at the end okay by the way if you're in changu this is where we are okay check us out kind of thing right. Got it now. Yeah, so that's the so that's good then like that. Yeah, so yeah maybe we need to make this a bit longer more informational. In terms of the layout though let's go back to this. What do you make the layout? So we've got featured stuff here. Yeah obviously I need to fix the fact that that gets cut off. Um like so the way I did it is like every section you said you want to make the sections less niche so they more clump together. What do you think about the UI of this? The UI is fine. Really? Yes, yes, yes. It's nice. Yeah. I love the way you do like, you know, it's both the title and then it's like the font that you choose. And then you put like a five minute read of this. And then the, you know, the what is called. Sustainability. Yes. The category. The category. Yeah. It's good. Okay. What would you think the client would want on the blog? Or is this basically okay? Well, when you talk about a restaurant and they have a blog and a website, it's not really an important thing. Okay, interesting. The only thing is that they want you to check on the website. 


I need to add a whole page just for events as well and then add an events section on the landing page. Yes, so event and uh maybe like you can put also the promotion on the same page or yeah, it can be on any page. Do you want promotion on every page? Like uh like little um like maybe little pop-ups which say oh by the way there's a promotion going on. No, no, no, no. Um, I mean like um when they the first time they they opened the the website there is like um a special promotion it's exactly on the first page, okay on the landing page, yeah okay I see. Um, and then when they click it and then there is also another special event or promotion on it. So should we have a promotions page like one page so it's on the landing page but then if they click it, should we just have one page showing maybe all the promotions like like this day we do this, this day we do this, this day we do this. Yeah, okay so we need a promotions page as well. See, I wouldn't think of this stuff unless uh your this is the membership page right? Um you worked on your membership thing so maybe you tell me like uh I don't know what benefits that you know maybe what benefits they'd want to do is that something. So most most of the restaurants doing like uh if they have like a membership they will give like the the guests like a discount like 20 or no 15 or 20. Okay and then like a free entry on all of the special events. Okay yeah like um if they have like uh free cocktails like that or uh start from six and yet or maybe like us uh good DJs coming at night they have to give the members free entry for events and then I want to do like different scales so we do like bronze we do silver what do you think maybe the what's the maximum percent we give away so for like it's only not forever it's just for top top members so I think in the restaurants it's better to use like uh the spending the total spending so if you want to go like uh to the gold one you have to spend this amount in the restaurants and see that's why we do points to the points like say every pound you spend or every yeah every pound you spend or every dollar or every like 10k every 20k you spend you get one point. Yes that's nice yeah and then this point can be read them also as a voucher as also discount on a meal discount on a meal free access to events discounts on meals maybe a free item drinks or something. What else membership benefits 3 is good but if we can try to get to 5 this points can be used for an item like hoodies or probably tumblr or maybe like healthy restaurants can be like shirts or something and stuff like that. Okay so if you get to diamond maybe you get a free t. Yeah yeah that what I say yeah okay and then um birthday rewards birthday rewards like if you come on your birthday we give you 20 percent off yes or we give you a free something there'll be work as well. Okay um early access okay okay okay what do you think the pricing should be maybe for like the membership like you spend so bronze everyone has but to get to silver how much you spend maybe like 100 pound or yeah probably like no more than that uh if they want to go to usb because I didn't spend uh one percent so it'd be like one time they come to restaurants 200 or 200 000 like 10 to 15 pounds about 10 pound yeah yeah and then they have to go to uh silver by five millions it's five million idea about 250 yes and then to gold maybe what 20 million yeah probably 20 million and then maybe like platinums one above will do it's 100 million a lot 100 million it's a lot for a coffee shop okay yeah it's for alcohol then yeah it's possible okay okay so maybe like shop is not too much um and then diamond top top top level yeah probably just make like uh so we just voicenote in starting count say well go on in a sec bronze silver and then gold maybe cool okay bronze only three yeah only three okay okay fine um okay so then like five million 20 million maybe 50 million yeah something like that okay cool that's my guys depending on you know the price of the menu yeah I mean we can always change it we've done chat we've done about us we've done blog we've done reviews we've done membership we've done menu and we did the landing page I believe we did oh yeah we did uh I just want to quickly get some feedback on that we've already done the landing page but is there anything we're missing on here promo you said we're missing we're missing promotion what else are we missing so we've got we've got the location any information about that gallery we've got the Instagram stuff which we're going to make sliding we've got like our story which links to the about us right just a little extra information reviews and then this will be specialty and then promotion yeah what are we missing do you think I mean to fix the hero it's too much going on yeah and it also probably uh it's just my opinion you know like um the opening hours something so if you sit on a landing page here we got opening we should if I'm not mistaken opening hours there oh already yeah um and then anything else or do you think just a bit higher oh and then you can see if you're logged in or not there this is like the account yeah sign out sign in if they're not signed in it will say at the bottom sign in for whatever to get first membership card or something yeah this would be like that yeah sign in like you're going like um get
