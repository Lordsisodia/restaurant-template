# Story Template · Milestone Timeline

- **Best for**: founding stories, brand history, or roadmap recaps.
- **Layout**: vertical timeline with year badges and alternating copy blocks powered by the shared GlassTimeline component.
- **Content fields**: `title`, `subtitle`, `milestones[]` (`id`, `year`, `title`, `description`, `imageUrl?`).
- **Notes**: keep milestone descriptions concise (2–3 sentences). Provide chronological ordering before rendering.
