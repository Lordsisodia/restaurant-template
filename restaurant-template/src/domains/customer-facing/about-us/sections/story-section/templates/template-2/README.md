# Story Template · Milestone Cards

- **Best for**: summarising key chapters when space is limited.
- **Layout**: responsive grid of milestone cards with year label, title, and description.
- **Content fields**: `title`, `subtitle`, `milestones[]` (uses first four entries by default).
- **Notes**: keep milestone copy short (80–100 chars) and prioritise most impactful events.
