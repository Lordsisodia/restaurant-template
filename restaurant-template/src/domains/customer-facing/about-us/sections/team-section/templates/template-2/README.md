# Team Template Â· Card Grid

- **Best for**: mid-page introductions where a carousel is too heavy.
- **Layout**: three-column responsive grid of team cards.
- **Content fields**: `title`, `subtitle`, `members[]` (uses photo, role, bio).
- **Notes**: limit bios to ~160 characters for even heights; ensure imagery is square.
