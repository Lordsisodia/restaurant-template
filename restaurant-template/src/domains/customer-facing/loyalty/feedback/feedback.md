# Loyalty Feedback Log

Use this living document to capture and resolve feedback specific to the loyalty / membership domain.

## How to use

1. Add new feedback items to the **Open Items** table with the date, source, and a short summary.
2. Update the **Status** column as work progresses (for example: `new`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`).
3. Once an item is completed, move it to **Resolved Items** so we preserve the history.
