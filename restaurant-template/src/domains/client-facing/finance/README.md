## Why This is Tier 3 (Future)

### Most Restaurants Use:

2. **POS System Financial Reports** - Square, Toast, Clover have built-in reporting
3. **External Bookkeeper/Accountant** - Professional financial management
4. **Simpler Tools** - Focus on operations, not complex financials

### Build This When:
- Restaurant wants all-in-one solution
- Current tools are disconnected
- Need custom financial workflows
- Integration costs are too high
- Specific compliance requirements
- Multi-location needs unified view

### Better Approach for Now:
- Focus on operational metrics (orders, reservations)
- Integrate with existing accounting software via API
- Export transaction data for accountant
- Basic revenue/expense tracking only
- Advanced financials = Phase 2/3

- Accuracy: 99.9% transaction matching
