# About Us Page - Final Updates & Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Coffee Icon Error** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** ValuesGrid component missing "coffee" icon causing render error
**Solution:** Added Coffee icon to lucide-react imports and iconMap

### 2. **Image Quality Warnings** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Next.js 16 requires quality values to be configured
**Solution:** Added `qualities: [75, 80, 90, 100]` to next.config.ts

### 3. **Hydration Mismatch** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Nested `<main>` tags (root layout + about layout)
**Solution:** Removed `<main>` wrapper from root layout.tsx, let page layouts control their own main tags

## 🎨 Design Consistency Updates

### Applied Landing Page Styling to All Sections:

#### **SectionHeading with Pills** - Now Used Everywhere:
- ✅ FAQ Section → "Common Questions" pill
- ✅ Location Section → "Find Us" pill
- ✅ Awards Section → "Customer Reviews" pill
- ✅ Venue Gallery → "Our Venue" pill

**Before:**
```tsx
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Title</h2>
<p className="text-lg">Subtitle</p>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<SectionHeading
  pillText="Pill Text"
  title={title}
  subtitle={subtitle}
  titleClassName="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold"
  as="h2"
  centered={true}
  className="mb-12"
/>
```

## 🗑️ Removed Redundant Content

### **Removed: Final CTA Section**
**Reason:** Already have CTAs in:
- Hero section (implicit - scroll down)
- Location section (WhatsApp + Call buttons)
- FAQ section ("Still have questions?" CTA)
- Footer (always present)

**Files Updated:**
- ❌ Removed `AboutCTA` component import from AboutPage.tsx
- ❌ Removed `cta: AboutCTAProps` from AboutPageData interface
- ❌ Removed `<AboutCTA {...data.cta} />` from page render
- ❌ Removed `cta` data from about/page.tsx

**Component Still Exists:** `src/domains/customer-facing/about-us/sections/cta-section/` (can be reused elsewhere if needed)
