This cozy spot turned out to be the perfect refuge for catching up on emails while enjoying a good cup of coffee and some light snacks .. Draco Coffee and Eatery also features dedicated co-working spaces and a meeting room, making it an ideal spot for both solo work and group meetings.

I ordered some of them and it taste good and has quite generous portion. Although the place is less fancy than usual coffee shops, but hey, you can spend time here all day by your laptop while enjoying breakfast, lunch, or dinner, they have it all. Overall it's pretty recommended!",

So hang on a second… This place deserves some good reviews, not because it’s the greatest thing in Bali but because of the staff. They remember me from a year ago, the same staff greeted me with enthusiasm and a smile. That makes this place really great in my books. The food is good, tasty and well presented. The coffee is also good and the place has private rooms for your meeting downstairs and work area upstairs. So go ahead and give it a try. The only thing that can improve are the washrooms. Guys the washrooms need to be a bit cleaner. More @zsoltzsemba",

This place has aircon in the inside and the outside sitting place is for smoking area purpose and they provided fan for outdoor setting. The menu is small but solid mix of indonesian / local and European type of cuisine and beverages. You could have coffee, tea, milk, herb drink, alcohol, mocktail, juice, cocktail, beer and arak (local booze) you could order from the cashier. For the menu they have appetizer, main course and snacks also pastry options. As always i ordered refreshing ice latte coffee (less sugar) (28k) and almond croissant and they were freshly brewed and the croissant is crisp enough and sweet for 20k. Their milkshake (35k) is also good! 4⭐/5 would like to eat again! Their service is nice and helpful enough too and they understand English speaker tourist, so go ahead and visit this eatery!",
