# Data Directory

This directory contains parsed data files and scraped content used during development.

## Files

### Review Data (JSON)
- **all-reviews-parsed.json** - All parsed reviews from Google Maps
- **parsed-reviews.json** - Processed review data
- **parsed-reviews-complete.json** - Complete review dataset with metadata

### Scraped Content
- **scraped-images/** - Google Maps scraped images and HTML (development only, gitignored)

## Usage

These JSON files are generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory and are used for importing review data into the database.

## Note

The `scraped-images/` directory is excluded from git by default as it contains development-only scraped content.
