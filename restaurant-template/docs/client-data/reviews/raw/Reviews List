On a day when I wasn’t keen on venturing far from home, I stumbled upon Draco Coffee and Eatery on Jalan Mahendradatta Selatan No.7b in Denpasar. This cozy spot turned out to be the perfect refuge for catching up on emails while enjoying a good cup of coffee and some light snacks .. Draco Coffee and Eatery also features dedicated co-working spaces and a meeting room, making it an ideal spot for both solo work and group meetings. Their operating hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM provide flexibility for various schedules.

Quite decent café in mahendradatta area, they serves complete meals from breakfast to dinner and actually also have wide range of menu from croissant, coffee, tea, western food, Indonesian food, healthy food, light bites and beers. I ordered some of them and it taste good and has quite generous portion. Although the place is less fancy than usual coffee shops, but hey, you can spend time here all day by your laptop while enjoying breakfast, lunch, or dinner, they have it all. Overall it's pretty recommended!

I have lived near Draco a year ago and I am back once more. So hang on a second… This place deserves some good reviews, not because it’s the greatest thing in Bali but because of the staff. They remember me from a year ago, the same staff greeted me with enthusiasm and a smile. That makes this place really great in my books. The food is good, tasty and well presented. The coffee is also good and the place has private rooms for your meeting downstairs and work area upstairs. So go ahead and give it a try. The only thing that can improve are the washrooms. Guys the washrooms need to be a bit cleaner. More @zsoltzsemba

Cozy place to have a small lunch and sip of coffee in the afternoon.
This place has aircon in the inside and the outside sitting place is for smoking area purpose and they provided fan for outdoor setting.
The menu is small but solid mix of indonesian / local and European type of cuisine and beverages.
You could have coffee, tea, milk, herb drink, alcohol, mocktail, juice, cocktail, beer and arak (local booze) you could order from the cashier.
For the menu they have appetizer, main course and snacks also pastry options.
As always i ordered refreshing ice latte coffee (less sugar) (28k) and almond croissant and they were freshly brewed and the croissant is crisp enough and sweet for 20k. Their milkshake (35k) is also good! 4⭐/5 would like to eat again!
Their service is nice and helpful enough too and they understand English speaker tourist, so go ahead and visit this eatery!

the wifi was fast enough to watch youtube, and the staff was nice. those are the only two reasons i would give them two stars, not one.

sofa cushions torn but unfixed, the vibe’s run down, people doing business meetings in loud voices, my hot latte served cold and tasteless. if you go there, you’ll see why i didn’t even feel like taking any pictures.

can’t regret enough why i didn’t simply settle for TOMORO nearby…

Let’s start it this way:

Menu online and actual menu in the restaurant varies (more expensive and excl. Tax)

Staff is rather playing TikTok behind the counter than taking care of the guests.

Food: if it would taste and look like within the menu it would be amazing, but this is unfortunately not the case.

Chicken Quesadillas had more sauce sambal, then anything else. Not talking about the chicken and cheese, it was almost not existing.

Not worth the money.

The cafe isn't very spacious, but it's comfortable for coffee and chatting with friends.

The Spaghetti Aglio Olio is delicious, not too oily, with large shrimp and a strong kick of spiciness.

The Original Fried Banana has a unique flavor, like a hint of spice.

The Hot Mochacino really has a chocolatey flavor, and it's delicious.

Thank you for providing a meeting room for me. The room has four chairs, electrical outlets, air conditioning, and is soundproof enough to avoid outside noise. I spent 150,000 Rupiah on a voucher for a minimal space. The food is delicious, and the prices are relatively reasonable for a cafe. Dine-in and takeout are available. It's a great place to work on assignments and meet people. There are smoking and non-smoking areas.

The staff/servers are friendly and informative. The bathrooms are in the back, which are nice and quite clean.

The food is good for one meal. The rice with chicken in egg crust was a bit too salty. The smoothie is tasty, but not wow.

Thank you for your review of our dining experience. We greatly appreciate your feedback.

We apologize for the less than satisfactory experience regarding the overly salty chicken in our rice dish with breaded chicken. We will speak to our kitchen team soon to ensure that the quality and proportion of our seasonings are maintained properly so that it is not too salty in the future.

Originally just wanted to sit down for a coffee but on a whim saw the menu there was soto, wow outside Nurul.. try the chicken soto.. one of the comfort foods that will be on my list 👍👍👍 drink ordered mojito, so an impressive duet. The room is comfortable and elegant, there is a place outside for those who like to drink. My advice for those who like to lie down after eating, this is a good place!
