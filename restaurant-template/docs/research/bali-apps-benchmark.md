# Bali Restaurant Apps — Benchmark (2025)

Status: draft • Owner: Product/Design • Updated: 2025‑10‑21

Scope: consumer apps/services widely used by diners in Bali for discovery, ordering, or reservations.

## Shortlist (5)
1) GoFood (Gojek) — delivery/pickup in Bali
- Presence: Gojek lists Bali as an operating area.
- Patterns to note: category chips, search prominence, promos, sticky cart, order tracking.

2) GrabFood (Grab) — delivery/pickup in Bali
- Presence: GrabFood operates in Indonesia and Bali (Grab’s food arm; now also owns Chope for dining/vouchers).
- Patterns: curated lists, free‑delivery thresholds, ratings badges, quick re‑order, merchant WhatsApp/contact.

3) ShopeeFood — delivery in Bali
- Presence: Shopee operates ShopeeFood in Indonesia; widely used by residents/visitors, with merchant onboarding in Bali.
- Patterns: aggressive vouchers, category tabs, location chips, checkout with ShopeePay.

4) Chope (Grab) — reservations and dining vouchers in Bali
- Presence: Dedicated Bali section with bookable restaurants; Grab acquired Chope in 2024 and is integrating dining/vouchers.
- Patterns: time slots with capacity, voucher purchase, map view, cuisine filters.

5) Traveloka Eats — discovery/dining deals (Bali)
- Presence: Traveloka has a Bali dining guide and previously offered Eats Delivery in Bali; still used for vouchers and discovery.
- Patterns: editorial lists (best of), vouchers, map search.

## What to copy into our template
- Discovery → Action funnel: category chips + “Popular near you/today” + immediate CTA (Order/Reserve/Call/WA).
- Re‑order speed: recent orders and popular dishes surfaced early (sticky cart patterns from GoFood/GrabFood).
- Deals clarity: specials and voucher surfacing (Chope/Traveloka patterns) but keep checkout friction low.
- Trust: ratings badges and review excerpts near primary actions.
- Local payments: GoPay/OVO/ShopeePay prominence at checkout where relevant.

## Gaps we won’t replicate
- Overbearing voucher walls that obscure core actions.
- App‑only gates that block basic flows on web.
