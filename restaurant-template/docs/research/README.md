# Research & Insights

Use this directory to ground UX and product decisions in real user data and competitive analysis.

- `user-needs-by-page.md` — Core customer expectations for each page.
- `bali-apps-benchmark.md` — Summary of mobile app research.
- `benchmarks/` — Deep dives on comparable Bali venues with a `benchmark-summary.md` roll-up.
- `archive/` — Historical research retained for reference (e.g. Elementree extraction).

If you add new research, create a standalone markdown file and update this README with a one-line description. Move outdated research to `archive/` instead of deleting it.
