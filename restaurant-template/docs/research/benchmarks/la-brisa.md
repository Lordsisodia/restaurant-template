# La Brisa (Canggu) — Product/UI Spec (mobile‑first)

- URL: https://labrisa-bali.com/
- Purpose: Beach club/restaurant; landing blends experiences, events, and reservations.

## Above‑the‑Fold
- Immersive hero (photo/video); immediate links to Reserve/Tickets/Events.
- Quick entrance to “What’s On” (markets, live events) within first scroll.

## Navigation
- Primary items include Reserve, What’s On, Menus, Gallery, Contact.
- Multi‑experience venue handled with clean sub‑pages; reservation CTA remains present.

## Core CTAs
- Reserve → booking flow
- Tickets/Events → event detail pages
- Menus → food/drink menus (PDF or web sections)

## Essentials
- Hours & address surfaced near footer and Contact; Instagram prominent.

## UI Patterns to Note
- Destination pattern: “experience first,” but actions (Reserve/Tickets) remain above the fold.
- Strong use of imagery; typography stays legible over media with overlays.

## Opportunities We Can Adopt
- Use a compact “Experiences/What’s On” slice below hero to add life to the landing.
- Keep Reserve in view at all times on mobile.
