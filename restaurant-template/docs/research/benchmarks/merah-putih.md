# Merah Putih (Seminyak) — Product/UI Spec (mobile‑first)

- URL: https://merahputihbali.com/
- Purpose: Modern Indonesian dining; booking + menu discovery with premium brand storytelling.

## Above‑the‑Fold
- Hero with copy headline and direct “Discover our food/drinks” CTAs.
- Delivery partners (GoFood/Grab) surfaced with badges/links near the hero.

## Navigation
- Simple primary nav; strong focus on Menus, Drinks, Reservations/Contact.

## Core CTAs
- Discover our Food / Drinks → menu sections.
- Order Now → external partners.

## Essentials
- Address and hours findable from footer/contact; reservations via phone or partner.

## UI Patterns to Note
- Premium yet clear: immediate menu entry and delivery partner visibility.
- Hero uses short copy instead of long paragraphs; keeps action density high above the fold.

## Opportunities We Can Adopt
- Keep partner badges near hero to reduce hunt time for off‑platform ordering.
