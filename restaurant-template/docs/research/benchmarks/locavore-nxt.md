- URL: https://locavorenxt.com/
- Purpose: High‑concept dining brand; booking‑led and story‑driven site.

## Above‑the‑Fold
- Minimal hero with strong brand voice; primary CTA “Book/Visit Locavore NXT”.

## Navigation
- Booking/Visit prominent in the nav; About/Experiences/Press/Journals as secondary.

## Core CTAs
