# Sisterfields (Seminyak) — Product/UI Spec (mobile‑first)

- URL: https://www.sisterfieldsbali.com/
- Purpose: All‑day brunch café; informational site with light booking policy and strong walk‑in bias.
- Source notes: Hours, address, booking policy, and ordering partners are taken from the public site.

## Above‑the‑Fold
- Hero: brand headline + short positioning line; primary CTA usually “Reserve Now” but copy clarifies walk‑ins first.
- Quick actions visible near top fold: hours, location, “Order online” with GoFood / Grab links.
- Content blocks: About teaser; Menu button; “Get Directions”.

## Navigation
- Simple top nav with About, Contact, Menu, Reservation.
- “Reserve a Table” CTA present but copy clarifies group booking policy (≥6 people; advance notice).

## Core CTAs
- Reserve Now → reservation policy page
- Order Online → external GoFood / GrabFood deep links
- Get Directions → opens maps with the Seminyak address

## Essentials
- Hours: Open daily 7AM–9PM
- Address: Jl. Kayu Cendana No.7, Seminyak (full line on site)
- Contact: phone / WhatsApp surfaced on Contact page

## UI Patterns to Note
- Café pattern done right: immediate clarity on hours, location, and whether to book vs. walk‑in.
- “Order online” partners surfaced early (no hunting), strong for mobile.
- Lightweight information density; minimal scroll to reach essentials.

## Opportunities We Can Adopt
- Put hours + map + partners as tappable chips near the hero.
- Clarify booking policy directly in the CTA subtitle.
