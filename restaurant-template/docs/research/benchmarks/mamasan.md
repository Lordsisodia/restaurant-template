# Mama San (Seminyak) — Product/UI Spec (mobile‑first)

- URL: https://mamasanbali.com/
- Purpose: Destination restaurant; editorial landing with menu promos, events, and prominent booking.

## Above‑the‑Fold
- Full‑bleed hero imagery, bold typography, and immediate “Book/Reserve” affordance.
- Campaign/What’s On tiles sit close to the hero; cards link to menus, events, and specials.

## Navigation
- Clear primary nav (Menu, Reservations, What’s On, Contact).
- Booking CTA remains accessible as a primary button or in sticky header state.

## Core CTAs
- Book a Table → reservation provider / in‑site form.
- View Menu → menu sections; seasonal menus highlighted.
- Private Dining / Events → enquiry form.

## Essentials
- Hours, address, contact found in footer and/or Contact page; WhatsApp link provided.

## UI Patterns to Note
- Strong editorial grid near top; menus and promos are first‑scroll.
- Booking CTA is always discoverable.

## Opportunities We Can Adopt
- Bring a compact “What’s On” row to our home first scroll for seasonal energy.
- Keep Reserve CTA visible even while scrolling the hero.
