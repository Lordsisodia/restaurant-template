## âœ… Task #1: Vertical Stack When Filtered

**Requirement**: When a specific category is selected from the filter, show items stacked vertically instead of horizontal scroll.

**Implementation**:
- Added `isFiltered` prop to `CategorySection` component
- When `filterCategory !== 'all'`, shows vertical stack
- When `filterCategory === 'all'`, shows horizontal scroll
- Created `MenuItemCardVertical` component (horizontal layout with image on left)
- Vertical cards: Image (96px square) + content on right
- Horizontal cards: Full image on top, content below

**Result**:
```
Showing All Categories â†’ Horizontal scroll per category
Filter to "Coffee" â†’ All Coffee items stacked vertically
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Better for browsing many items in one category
- âœ… Faster scrolling through filtered items
- âœ… Compact list view
- âœ… Still shows horizontal scroll when viewing all
