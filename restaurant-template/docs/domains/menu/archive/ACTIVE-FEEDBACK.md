## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. ‚úÖ Supabase Connection - FIXED
**Issue**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is required but not set`
**Root Cause**: Dev server not restarted after .env.local updated
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED**

**What Was Done**:
- [x] .env.local file exists ‚úÖ
- [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is set ‚úÖ
- [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set ‚úÖ

### 2. ‚ùå Mobile Cards Don't Fit on Screen
**Issue**: Cards are too large, don't fit properly on mobile view
**Impact**: Poor mobile UX, unusable on phones
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Status**: üî¥ **TO FIX**

**User Feedback**:
> "The cards don't fit onto the page for mobile. You have to scroll and they just don't fit on the mobile view."
> "Also, I want the cards to scroll horizontally. I think that would be much better. Just so we can see all the options horizontally."

**Current Card Size**: 280px √ó 360px (TOO BIG)
**Problem**: Cards are forcing horizontal scroll, but not sized properly for viewport

**Solution** (User wants horizontal scroll):
- [ ] Keep horizontal scroll (user preference)
- [ ] Reduce card width to ~85vw (fits better in viewport)
- [ ] Reduce card height to fit in viewport (~70vh max)
- [ ] Add snap scrolling for smooth navigation
- [ ] Show partial next card (peek) to indicate scrollability

### 3. ‚ùå Category Selection Not Clean
**Issue**: Current category tabs are not intuitive/clean
**Impact**: Poor UX, confusing navigation
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Status**: üî¥ **TO FIX**

**User Feedback**:
> "I don't like how the categories are selected. There must be a cleaner way - I feel like there just must be."

**Current**: Horizontal scroll tabs (pill-shaped buttons)
**Problem**: Not clean, not intuitive

**Better Solutions to Try**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Dropdown selector (single tap to see all categories)
- [ ] **Option B**: Fixed grid of icon-based category buttons (2√ó4 grid)
- [ ] **Option C**: Sticky category filter bar with icons
- [ ] **Option D**: Swipeable category cards with images
- [ ] **Option E**: Bottom sheet with all categories

**DECISION NEEDED**: Which option to implement?

### 4. ‚úÖ Cards Could Be Much Nicer - FIXED

**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED**

**User Feedback**:
> "The cards could be much nicer."

**Solution Implemented**: Premium card design (see IMPROVEMENTS-SUMMARY.md)

### 5. ‚úÖ Categories - FIXED & ANALYZED
**Issue**: Current categories don't match actual menu structure
**Root Cause**: Wrong table name + wrong assumptions about data structure
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED**

**User Feedback**:
> "The categories are all messed up. You should actually look at the menu (the 104 items) and see what categories you can actually break them down into."

**What I Found**:
- [x] Actual items: **73 items** (not 104)
- [x] Table name: `menu_items` (not `item`)
- [x] Category field: `category` TEXT (not `category_id` FK)
- [x] Real categories: **15 categories** from actual data

**Real Categories** (73 items total):
1. Coffee (11 items)
2. Rice Bowl (8 items)
3. Smoothies (7 items)
4. Specialty Drinks (6 items)
5. Indonesian (6 items)
6. To Share (5 items)
7. Juice (5 items)
8. Cocktails (4 items)
9. Pastry (4 items)
10. Breakfast (4 items)
11. Mocktails (3 items)
12. Pizza (3 items)
13. Pasta (3 items)
14. Burgers (2 items)
15. Dessert (2 items)

**Fixes Applied**:
- [x] Updated `menu.service.ts` to query `menu_items` table
- [x] Changed filter from `active` to `is_available`
- [x] Changed category from `category_id` to `category` (TEXT)
- [x] Categories now derived from actual distinct values in database
- [x] Service properly maps all fields

**See**: `ACTUAL-MENU-DATA.md` for full breakdown

### 6. ‚úÖ "All" Category - ADDED
**Issue**: No way to browse all items without selecting category
**Impact**: Users can't see everything at once
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Status**: üü¢ **FIXED**

**User Feedback**:
> "There should also be a section that says 'All' ‚Äî a category that says 'All' so you can just scroll through all the menu items."

**Solution Implemented**:
- [x] Added "All" as first option in category selector
- [x] When "All" selected, shows all 73 items
- [x] Horizontal scroll works for all items
- [x] "All" is the default selected category on page load
- [x] "All" appears in bold to distinguish it

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add "All" at the beginning
const categories = [
  { id: 'all', name: 'All', description: 'Browse all menu items' },
  ...realCategories
];

// Default to "All"
const [selectedCategory] = useState('all');

// Filter logic
const items = selectedCategory === 'all'
  ? allItems
  : allItems.filter(item => item.category === selectedCategory);
```

**Result**:
- Users land on page ‚Üí See "All" (73 items)
- Can scroll through everything horizontally
- Or select specific category from dropdown
