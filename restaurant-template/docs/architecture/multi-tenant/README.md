# Multi-Tenant Strategies

Reference guides that shape the shared infrastructure and deployment posture:

- Cloud tooling: `CLOUDINARY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HYBRID-IMAGE-STRATEGY.md`, `IMAGE-STRATEGY-CHEATSHEET.md`
- Supabase & data operations: `SUPABASE-OPTIMIZATION-STRATEGY.md`, `HARDCODE-VS-DATABASE-DECISION.md`
- Deployment constraints: `VERCEL-250MB-LIMIT-STRATEGY.md`, `MULTI-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md`, `SMALL-SCALE-OPTIMIZATION.md`
- Restaurant-specific finalisations: `DRACO-FINAL-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `COMPLETE-IMAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SHARED-INFRASTRUCTURE-STRATEGY.md`

Keep this directory focused on long-term platform choices; move per-tenant execution notes into `docs/project-history/` once implemented.
