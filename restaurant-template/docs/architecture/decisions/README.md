# Architecture Decisions (ADR Index)

Document significant technical decisions here. Each ADR:
- Lives in this directory as `adr-XXXX-title.md` (increment numbers).
- Explains context, decision, status, and consequences.
- Links to relevant code/docs.

## Existing ADRs
- `adr-0001-mobile-nav-pattern.md` â€“ Adopted mobile navigation pattern for MVX work.

## Creating a new ADR
1. Copy `adr-template.md` (see below) to `adr-XXXX-your-title.md` with the next number.
2. Fill in context, decision, alternatives, and outcomes.
3. Update this README with the new ADR entry.

Use ADRs when a decision influences architecture, cross-team standards, or introduces trade-offs that future engineers must understand.
