# Integrations

How to stitch shared features together and keep multi-tenant data in sync:

- `MENU-DOMAIN-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` – link Supabase data, domain templates, and tenant config for the menu experience.
- `FOOTER-MOBILE-UX-GUIDE.md`, `RESTAURANT-FOOTER-ENHANCEMENT-PLAN.md`, `RESTAURANT-FOOTER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` – end-to-end footer improvements from plan through implementation.
- `TENANT-DATA-UPDATED.md` – notes from the last multi-tenant data refresh.

Update these files whenever integrations change so downstream domains stay aligned.

> **Notes:** Integrations currently skew toward footer/menu pipelines. When loyalty, chat, or other cross-domain touchpoints ship, add companion guides here (or link to relevant ADRs) so multi-tenant responsibilities remain discoverable.
