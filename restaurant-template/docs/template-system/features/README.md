# Shared Features

Guides for core template capabilities that every tenant can enable. Each markdown file deep-dives into a single area:

- `LANDING-PAGE-STRATEGY.md` – content blocks, hero variations, and conversion cues.
- `MENU-INTEGRATION-COMPLETE.md` – Supabase-backed menu integration (baseline implementation).
- `MENU-FILTER-FEATURE.md` – filtering/search enhancements planned for the menu experience.
- `FOOTER-INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md` & `FOOTER-VARIATIONS-GUIDE.md` – footer architecture plus variation catalog.
- `LAZY-LOADING-GUIDE.md` – performance improvements and implementation notes.

Use these when extending template behaviour; log any major changes back here so the shared platform stays consistent.

> **Roadmap:** Coverage today is biased toward menu and footer work. As other shared experiences (loyalty, blog, reservations, etc.) solidify, add equivalent guides or link out to their domain READMEs so this folder remains the jumping-off point for platform-wide features.
