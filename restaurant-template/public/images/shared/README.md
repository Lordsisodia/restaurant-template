# Shared Image Assets

Assets in this folder ship with every copy of the restaurant template. They’re safe defaults that help the UI look polished before real photography arrives.

- `backgrounds/` – Large hero, slider, and drawer textures.
- `defaults/` – Placeholder hero and dish images used as component fallbacks.
- `gallery/` – Generic lifestyle/gallery imagery you can use across tenants.
- `icons/` – UI icons and social badges (SVG only).
- `partners/` – Third-party partner logos (GrabFood, GoFood, etc.).

When referencing these in code, use `/images/shared/...`. If you add or remove a shared asset, update this README so future contributors know what is available by default.
