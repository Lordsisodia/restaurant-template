# Restaurant Mobile MVX

Guidelines for building mobile-first experiences across domains.

## Principles
- Prioritize thumb-friendly CTAs and 16px minimum tap targets.
- Keep hero copy under 70 characters; stack supporting text beneath visuals.
- Use shared spacing scale (`4px` increments) for layout consistency.

## Patterns
- **Landing:** sticky CTA button for reservations or ordering.
- **Menu:** segmented control for categories; floating add-to-order button.
- **Chat:** slide-up drawer with always-visible quick replies.

## Accessibility
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio on text.
- Provide screen reader labels for icons and chat controls.
- Support reduced motion by disabling template entrance animations.
